I made this demo just to see how powerful CSS 3D actually is, and I got a bit carried away...

I was also curious to see how good CSS is for making computer games (spoiler alert: it's not).

I wanted to try to keep as much of the visual stuff within CSS as possible and use JS only for game logic.

## Getting Started

Clone the repo locally.

This was built with Node 10.13. If you're using NVM make sure you run `nvm use` before installing.

```shell
$ npm install
$ npm run serve
``` 

Open a browser and go to `http://localhost:8080`
