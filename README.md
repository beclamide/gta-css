# GTA CSS
## A technical demo of how CSS 3D works

I made this demo just to see how powerful CSS 3D actually is, and I got a bit carried away...

I was also curious to see how good CSS is for making computer games (spoiler alert: it's not).

I wanted to try to keep as much of the visual stuff within CSS as possible and use JS only for game logic.

## Getting Started

Clone the repo locally.

This was built with Node 10.13. If you're using NVM make sure you run `nvm use` before installing.

```shell
$ npm install
$ npm run serve
``` 

Open a browser and go to `http://localhost:8080`

## How to play

| Brake            | Down Arrow        |
| Steer Left/Right | Left/Right Arrows |

If you'd like to contribute to this project, feel free to work on a feature branch. Raise a PR when it's ready for review.

There are a few locked branches that go along with my talk on CSS 3D that show the demo in various states of development.
