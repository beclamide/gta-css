I made this demo just to see how powerful CSS 3D actually is, and I got a bit carried away...

I was also curious to see how good CSS is for making computer games.

I wanted to try to keep as much of the visual stuff within CSS as possible and use JS only for game logic.

## Getting Started

Clone the repo locally.

This was built with Node 10.13. If you're using NVM make sure you run `nvm use` before installing.

```shell
$ npm install
$ npm run serve
``` 

Open a browser and go to `http://localhost:8080`

## How to play

| Action           | Keys              |
| ---------------- | ----------------- |
| Accelerate       | Up Arrow          |
| Brake            | Down Arrow        |
| Steer Left/Right | Left/Right Arrows |

There are now mobile controls too!

## Slides

I've added a slide deck that goes along with my talk (video link to be added later). They explain some of the process and development of the demo.
